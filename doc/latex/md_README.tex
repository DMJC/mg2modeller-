A 3d modeller inspired by Caligari Truespace and another popular 3d modelling tool. Written in G\+TK and C++.



Development Notes\+: Primarily developed using Code\+Lite I\+DE, can be built using either the C\+LI or Code\+Lite. Simply type Make in the toplevel. Requirs G\+T\+K\+MM 3.\+0, and glade/gtkbuilder.

Coding Style\+: Indentation should use four spaces. Callback functions are declared using extern \char`\"{}\+C\char`\"{}. This is to work around a limitation with gtkbuilder files and C++.
